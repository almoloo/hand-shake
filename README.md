Handshake is a decentralized application (dApp) that facilitates secure and verifiable chat sessions between two parties. By integrating cutting-edge blockchain technologies, Handshake offers a comprehensive solution for transparent and trustworthy online communications.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Features

1. **Secure Chat Sessions**

   Handshake uses Push Protocol to enable seamless and secure chat sessions between users. Push Protocol provides reliable messaging services with end-to-end encryption, ensuring the privacy and safety of your conversations.

2. **Digital Signing**
   Handshake incorporates Sign Protocol to allow both parties to sign the chat data once the conversation is complete. This digital signature verifies the authenticity and integrity of the chat, creating a verifiable proof of the interaction.
3. **Immutable Storage**
   The signed chat data is stored using Filecoin, a decentralized storage network. Filecoin's robust infrastructure ensures that your data is safely and securely stored with redundancy and resilience, providing an immutable record of your conversations.

## ‚ùì How Handshake Works

1. **Start a Chat**
   - Invite another party to engage in a chat session using the Handshake platform.
   - Utilize Push Protocol's secure messaging services for encrypted communication.
2. **Sign the Chat**
   - Once the chat session is complete, both parties can agree to digitally sign the chat data using Sign Protocol.
   - The digital signatures ensure the authenticity and integrity of the conversation.
3. **Store on Blockchain**
   - After signing, the chat data is securely stored on the Filecoin network.
   - The signed chat data is now an immutable record on the blockchain, accessible for verification by both parties.
